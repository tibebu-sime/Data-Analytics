The objective of this data analysis is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. Casual riders are customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes while members are customers who purchase annual memberships.\nBusiness Task\nThe new marketing strategy requires us to understand the following three components: behavioral differences between annual members and casual riders, reasons why a casual rider would buy Cyclistic annual memberships, and how digital media can influence casual riders to become members. The marketing analytics team is tasked with using past historical trip data to find the behavioral differences between annual members and casual riders and report their findings to the key stakeholders.\n\n### **Stakeholders**\n\n1. ***Cyclistic***: A bike-share company based out of the City of Chicago that features more than 5800 bicycles and 600 docking stations.\n2. ***Lily Moreno***: The director of marketing department who is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program through email, social media & other channels.\n3. ***Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team***: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.\n4. ***Cyclistic Executive Team***: The detail-oriented executive team who will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program. \n\n### **Data Source**\n\nThe data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. & the City of Chicago under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). This dataset contains the previous 12 months of trip data from Chicago's Divvy Ride Share Service for the period January to December 2021. The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). All riders' personal information has been removed for privacy issues.\n\n### **Data Dictionary**\n\n1. `ride_id`: unique id of each ride\n2. `rideable_type`: category of bike type such as classic, electric and docked\n3. `started_at`: start time of ride\n4. `ended_at`: end time of ride\n5. `start_station_name`: name of station the ride started at\n6. `start_station_id`: unique id of station the ride started at\n7. `end_station_name`: name of station the ride ended at\n8. `end_station_id`: unique id of station the ride ended at\n9. `start_lat`: latitudinal coordinate of start station\n10. `start_lng`: longitudinal coordinate of start station\n11. `end_lat`: latitudinal coordinate of end station\n12. `end_lng`: longitudinal coordinate of end station\n13. `member_casual`: category of rider type (casual, member)\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **A.

Casual riders use bike-sharing services more over the weekends for leisure while members use them consistently throughout the entire week to commute to work.\n3. Annual members predominately use classic bikes and rarely use docked bikes while casual riders are open to all kinds of bikes but prefer docked bikes.\n\n\n### **Recommendations**\n\n1. Lower the price of single-ride and full-day tickets casual rides so that they will be enticed to use bikes during the weekdays\n2. Offer attractive promotions like 20% to 30 % discount on the first year subscription to make casual riders become annual members \n3. Give a two-week free trial for casual riders who want to first try the bike-sharing service before committing to the annual plan.\n\n\n### **Additional Data for Further Analysis**\n\n1. Plans & pricing: this data can be used to optimize the cost benefit analysis for existing customers and potential new customers.  Consider creating a seasonal special price for summer and winter seasons\n2. Age and gender profile: this data can be used to study the age and gender category of the riders so that the marketing team will efficiently use their budget to target potential customers\n3. Neighborhood details: this can be used to investigate the riders’ bike usage based on the residential areas so that the marketing team create promotions or make advertisements accordingly. \n","metadata":{}}]}
